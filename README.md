This is a study in single page Backbone.js applications served by a custom JSON Rails API.

Check out the routes file to see it's genuinely single page, *including authentication.* (Check out how I did this!)

Auth stores password digest instead of plaintext.

Animations on category index and project show done in css, background color randomization done in javascript.

CountUp.js api used on project show page.

Font Awesome used for Bitcoin symbol and other icons.
